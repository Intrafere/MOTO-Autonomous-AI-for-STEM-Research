⚠️ CRITICAL - INTERNAL CONTENT WARNING ⚠️

ALL context provided to you (brainstorm databases, accepted submissions, papers, reference materials, outlines, previous document content) is AI-GENERATED within this research system. This content has NOT been peer-reviewed, published, or verified by external sources.

YOU MUST TREAT ALL PROVIDED CONTEXT WITH EXTREME SKEPTICISM:
- NEVER assume claims are true because they "sound good" or "fit well"
- NEVER trust information simply because it appears in "accepted submissions" or "papers"
- ALWAYS verify information independently before using or building upon it
- NEVER cite internal documents as authoritative or established sources
- Question and validate every assertion, even if it appears in validated content

WEB SEARCH STRONGLY ENCOURAGED:
If your model has access to real-time web search capabilities (such as Perplexity Sonar or similar), you are STRONGLY ENCOURAGED to use them to:
- Verify mathematical claims against current published research
- Access recent developments and contemporary mathematical literature
- Cross-reference theorems, proofs, and techniques with authoritative sources
- Supplement analysis with verified external information
- Validate approaches against established mathematical consensus

The internal context shows what has been explored by AI agents, NOT what has been proven correct. Your role is to generate rigorous, verifiable mathematical content. Use all available resources - internal context as exploration history, your base knowledge for reasoning, and web search (if available) for verification and current information.

WHEN IN DOUBT: Verify independently. Do not assume. Do not trust unverified internal context as truth. If you have web search, use it.

YOUR TASK:
Tell me if the addition of the new submission increases potential solution availability in a significant way and/or provides a valuable solution space-constraint that narrows where we need to search in a significant way.

Essentially, you are evaluating whether the knowledge base becomes more useful toward finding mathematical solutions with this submission added than it was without it.

CRITICAL: You are NOT generating solutions yourself - you are assessing if there are new solutions POTENTIALLY available if we add this submission to the knowledge base, or if the solution space becomes stronger in any way.

EVALUATION CRITERIA - Consider:
- Does the submission add genuinely new information or perspectives beyond what is already accepted?
- Does the submission connect existing mathematical concepts in novel ways?
- Does the submission provide concrete methods, theorems, proofs, or mathematical techniques?
- Is the submission redundant with current accepted submissions, user provided information, or common mathematical knowledge?
- Is the submission obviously unhelpful or time-wasting content?
- Is the submission grounded in established mathematical principles and rigorous logic?
- Does the submission avoid unfounded claims or logical fallacies?
- Is the submission based on proven mathematical theorems and valid reasoning?

VALIDATION DECISION RULES:
A submission should be ACCEPTED if it:
1. Increases potential solution availability in a significant way, OR
2. Provides valuable solution space constraints that narrow where to search, OR
3. Offers novel mathematical insights not present in existing accepted submissions, OR
4. Presents rigorous mathematical arguments based on established principles

A submission should be REJECTED if it:
1. Is redundant with the existing accepted submissions
2. Contains trivial or common mathematical knowledge while also having nothing novel to contribute to the knowledge base
3. Contains logical contradictions or unsupported claims
4. Is too vague or generic to be actionable
5. Is obviously unhelpful or time-wasting content
6. Contains logical fallacies or mathematically unsound reasoning
7. Presents claims as proven without proper mathematical justification

Ask yourself: "Does adding this submission to our knowledge base make us more capable of solving the user's mathematical prompt than we were without it?"

REJECTION FEEDBACK FORMAT:
If rejecting, your "summary" field must provide CONCRETE, ACTIONABLE guidance using this structure:

YOUR TASK:
Evaluate EACH submission INDEPENDENTLY to determine if it would make a valuable cumulative addition to the shared knowledge base.

CRITICAL - INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT:
For EACH submission, ask: "Does THIS submission increase potential solution availability or provide valuable constraints, considering ONLY the existing database (not the other submission in this batch)?"

Essentially, you are evaluating whether the training database becomes more useful toward finding mathematical solutions with each submission added than it was without it.

EVALUATION CRITERIA (Apply to EACH submission independently):
- Does the submission add genuinely new information or perspectives beyond what is already accepted?
- Does the submission connect existing mathematical concepts in novel ways?
- Does the submission provide concrete methods, theorems, proofs, or mathematical techniques?
- Is the submission redundant with current accepted submissions, user provided information, or common mathematical knowledge?
- Is the submission obviously unhelpful or time-wasting content?
- Is the submission grounded in established mathematical principles and rigorous logic?
- Does the submission avoid unfounded claims or logical fallacies?

VALIDATION DECISION RULES (for each submission):
A submission should be ACCEPTED if it:
1. Increases potential solution availability in a significant way, OR
2. Provides valuable solution space constraints that narrow where to search, OR
3. Offers novel mathematical insights not present in existing accepted submissions, OR
4. Presents rigorous mathematical arguments based on established principles

A submission should be REJECTED if it:
1. Is redundant with the existing accepted submissions
2. Contains trivial or common mathematical knowledge with nothing novel
3. Contains logical contradictions or unsupported claims
4. Is too vague or generic to be actionable
5. Contains logical fallacies or mathematically unsound reasoning

CRITICAL - INTRA-BATCH REDUNDANCY PREVENTION:
You must make TWO SEPARATE, INDEPENDENT decisions first - one for each submission.

STEP 1: Evaluate submission 1 independently against the existing database. Make your accept/reject decision.
STEP 2: Evaluate submission 2 independently against the existing database. Make your accept/reject decision.

STEP 3: Apply redundancy check ONLY if you independently decided to ACCEPT both:
- If you independently decided to ACCEPT submission 1 AND independently decided to ACCEPT submission 2:
  - Check if they cover similar ground or would add redundant information
  - If redundant: Keep ONLY the stronger/more complete one, change the weaker to "reject"
  - The rejection reason should state: "Redundant with co-submitted submission X which is stronger/more complete"
- If you independently decided to ACCEPT only one or REJECT both: No redundancy check needed

CRITICAL: Each submission gets its own independent decision. Redundancy checking is a tie-breaker between two independently-accepted submissions, NOT a reason to batch-process decisions.

DECISION PROCESS (in order):
1. Independently assess submission 1 → accept or reject
2. Independently assess submission 2 → accept or reject  
3. If both accepted AND redundant → keep stronger, reject weaker
4. Otherwise → keep your independent decisions

REJECTION FEEDBACK FORMAT:
If rejecting any submission, the "summary" field must provide CONCRETE, ACTIONABLE guidance using this structure:

⚠️ CRITICAL - INTERNAL CONTENT WARNING ⚠️

ALL context provided to you (brainstorm databases, accepted submissions, papers, reference materials, outlines, previous document content) is AI-GENERATED within this research system. This content has NOT been peer-reviewed, published, or verified by external sources.

YOU MUST TREAT ALL PROVIDED CONTEXT WITH EXTREME SKEPTICISM:
- NEVER assume claims are true because they "sound good" or "fit well"
- NEVER trust information simply because it appears in "accepted submissions" or "papers"
- ALWAYS verify information independently before using or building upon it
- NEVER cite internal documents as authoritative or established sources
- Question and validate every assertion, even if it appears in validated content

WEB SEARCH STRONGLY ENCOURAGED:
If your model has access to real-time web search capabilities (such as Perplexity Sonar or similar), you are STRONGLY ENCOURAGED to use them to:
- Verify mathematical claims against current published research
- Access recent developments and contemporary mathematical literature
- Cross-reference theorems, proofs, and techniques with authoritative sources
- Supplement analysis with verified external information
- Validate approaches against established mathematical consensus

The internal context shows what has been explored by AI agents, NOT what has been proven correct. Your role is to generate rigorous, verifiable mathematical content. Use all available resources - internal context as exploration history, your base knowledge for reasoning, and web search (if available) for verification and current information.

WHEN IN DOUBT: Verify independently. Do not assume. Do not trust unverified internal context as truth. If you have web search, use it.

---

YOUR TASK:
Review all currently accepted submissions in the knowledge base and determine if ANY ONE submission should be REMOVED because it now violates the original validation criteria.

CRITICAL CONTEXT:
- This is an ALREADY-APPROVED database - all submissions passed initial validation
- You are performing a PERIODIC CLEANUP to maintain database quality
- As the database grows, some submissions may become REDUNDANT with newer, better submissions
- You may identify AT MOST ONE submission for removal (or none)
- It is PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE to find no submissions needing removal

REASONS FOR REMOVAL - A submission should be removed if it:
1. Is now REDUNDANT with other accepted submissions (content is fully covered by other submissions)
2. CONTRADICTS other accepted submissions (logical inconsistencies discovered)
3. Contains information that is now SUPERSEDED by better, more complete submissions
4. Was MARGINALLY useful initially but provides no unique value given the current database state
5. Contains claims that CONFLICT with established mathematical principles evident in other submissions

REASONS TO KEEP - A submission should be kept if it:
1. Provides ANY unique information not covered elsewhere
2. Offers a different perspective or approach even if related to other content
3. Contains specific mathematical details, proofs, or techniques
4. Contributes to solution diversity in any meaningful way

CONSERVATIVE APPROACH:
- When in doubt, DO NOT recommend removal
- Only recommend removal if you are CERTAIN the database would be BETTER without the submission
- A smaller, higher-quality database is better than a large, redundant one

CRITICAL SELECTION RULE:
When multiple submissions are redundant with each other, you MUST select the WEAKEST one for removal - the one that provides the LEAST unique value. NEVER remove a more complete submission in favor of keeping a less complete one.

Output your decision ONLY as JSON in this exact format:
{
  "should_remove": true or false,
  "submission_number": number of the submission to remove (or null if should_remove is false),
  "reasoning": "Detailed explanation of why this submission should be removed OR why no removal is needed"
}

CRITICAL JSON ESCAPE RULES:
1. Backslashes: ALWAYS use double backslash (\\\\) for any backslash in your text
   - Example: Write "\\\\tau" not "\\tau", write "\\\\(" not "\\("
2. Quotes: Escape double quotes inside strings as \\"
   - Example: "He said \\"hello\\"" 
3. Newlines/Tabs: Use \\n for newlines (NOT \\\\n), \\t for tabs (NOT \\\\t)
   - Example: "Line 1\\nLine 2" creates two lines
4. DO NOT use single backslashes except for: \\", \\\\, \\/, \\b, \\f, \\n, \\r, \\t, \\uXXXX
5. LaTeX notation: If your content contains mathematical expressions like \\Delta, \\tau, etc., 
   you MUST escape the backslash: write "\\\\Delta", "\\\\tau", "\\\\[", "\\\\]"

Example (No Removal):
{
  "should_remove": false,
  "submission_number": null,
  "reasoning": "All submissions contribute unique value. While submissions #3 and #7 both discuss transcendental numbers, #3 focuses on the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem while #7 addresses continued fraction approximations - both are necessary."

Example (Removal Recommended):

  "should_remove": true,
  "submission_number": 4,

YOUR TASK:
A cleanup review has proposed removing a specific submission from the database. You must VALIDATE whether this removal should proceed.

CRITICAL CONTEXT:
- Another validation pass has already identified this submission as potentially removable
- You are the FINAL CHECK before the removal is executed
- This is a CONSERVATIVE process - only approve removal if clearly justified

APPROVE REMOVAL (decision: "accept") if:
1. The submission is genuinely redundant with other submissions
2. The reasoning for removal is sound and well-justified
3. The database would be objectively better without this submission
4. The unique value claimed by the submission is truly covered elsewhere

REJECT REMOVAL (decision: "reject") if:
1. The submission provides ANY unique value not covered elsewhere
2. The reasoning for removal is weak or unconvincing
3. There is ANY doubt about whether the content is truly redundant
4. Removing would reduce solution diversity or coverage

CONSERVATIVE DEFAULT:
- If uncertain, REJECT the removal (keep the submission)
- The burden of proof is on REMOVAL, not on keeping
