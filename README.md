## 🎯 What This System Does

MOTO is a three-tier autonomous AI research system:

- **Tier 1 (Aggregator)**: 1-10 AI agents work in parallel to explore mathematical concepts and build validated knowledge databases
- **Tier 2 (Compiler)**: Sequential AI agents compile knowledge into coherent academic papers with rigorous validation
- **Tier 3 (Autonomous Research)**: System autonomously selects topics, generates papers, and synthesizes final answers

### Key Features

- 🤖 **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Configurable 1-10 parallel submitters + 1 validator
- 🧠 **Advanced RAG System**: 4-stage retrieval pipeline with semantic search and citation tracking
- 📄 **Automated Paper Generation**: Creates structured academic papers with mathematical rigor
- 🔄 **Autonomous Topic Selection**: AI chooses research avenues based on high-level goals
- 🔒 **OpenRouter Integration**: Supports both local (LM Studio) and cloud (OpenRouter) models
- ⚡ **API Boost Mode**: Selective task acceleration with usage tracking
- 📊 **Real-time Monitoring**: Live metrics, acceptance rates, and workflow visualization

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before installation, you need:

1. **Python 3.8+** - [Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
2. **Node.js 16+** - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
3. **LM Studio** (optional but HIGHLY recommended - otherwise your system will need to pay OpenRouter for RAG embedding calls, which is very slow compared to LM studio's local embeddings) - [Download here](https://lmstudio.ai/)
   - If using open router, then download and load at least one model (e.g., DeepSeek, Llama, Qwen - older models and some models below 12 billion parameters may struggle, however it is always worth a try!)
   - **Load the LM Studio RAG agent [optional but HIGHLY recommended for much faster outputs/answers]**: Load the embedding model `nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5` in your LM studio "Developer" tab (server tab) (search for "nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5" to download it in the LM studio downloads center). Please note: you may need to enable "Power User" or "Developer" to see this developer tab - this server will let you load the amount and capacity of simultaneous models that your PC will suport. In this develop tab is where you load both your nomic-ai embedding agent and any optional local hosted agents you want to use in the program (I.e. GPT OSS 20b, DeepSeek 32B, etc). **If you do not not download LM studio and enable the Nomic agent the system will run much slower and cost a slightly more due to having to use the paid service OpenRouter for RAG calls.**
   - Start the local server (port 1234)
4.) **If using cloud AI - Get an OpenRouter API key**: Sign up at OpenRouter.ai and get a paid or free API key to use the most powerful cloud models available from your favorite providers. OpenRouter may also offer a certain amount of free API calls per day with your account key. When you download the MOTO deep research harness, you can see which models are free by checking the "show only free models" check box(es) in the MOTO app settings.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Model Selection

**Aggregator**:
- 1-10 submitters (configurable, default 3)
- Each submitter can use different models
- Single validator model (for coherent Markov chain)

**Compiler**:
- Validator model (coherence/rigor checking)
- High-context model (outline, construction, review)
- High-parameter model (rigor enhancement)

**Autonomous Research**:
- All aggregator and compiler roles configurable
- Separate models for topic selection, completion review, etc.

### OpenRouter Integration

Each role supports:
- **Provider**: LM Studio (local) or OpenRouter (cloud)
- **Model Selection**: Choose from available models
- **Host/Provider**: Select specific OpenRouter provider (e.g., Anthropic, Google)
- **Fallback**: Optional LM Studio fallback if OpenRouter fails

### Context and Output Settings

All configurable per role:
- **Context Window**: Default 131072 tokens (user-adjustable)
- **Max Output Tokens**: Default 25000 tokens (recommended for reasoning models)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

**"Python not recognized"**
- Reinstall Python and check "Add Python to PATH"
- Verify: `python --version` in terminal

**"Node not recognized"**
- Install Node.js from nodejs.org
- Verify: `node --version` in terminal

**"pip install failed"**
- Check internet connection
- Try: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
- Run as administrator if permission errors

### Runtime Issues

**"Failed to connect to LM Studio"**
- Ensure LM Studio is running
- Start the local server in LM Studio (port 1234)
- Load at least one model
- Load embedding model: `nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5`

**"Port already in use"**
- Close other apps using ports 8000 or 5173
- Restart computer if needed
- Use different ports in config

**High rejection rate**
- Check models are generating valid JSON
- Review validator reasoning in logs
- Ensure prompt is clear and specific
- Use larger models for better results

**System running slow**
- Use faster/smaller models
- Reduce context window size
- Close resource-intensive apps
- Check RAG cache performance in logs

### Common Error Messages

**"ChromaDB corruption detected"**
- Delete `backend/data/chroma_db` folder
- Restart the system (launcher cleans ChromaDB automatically)

**"Context window exceeded"**
- Reduce context size in settings
- System will automatically offload to RAG
- Check logs for detailed token usage
