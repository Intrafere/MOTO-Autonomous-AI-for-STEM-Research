WHEN IN DOUBT: Verify independently. Do not assume. Do not trust unverified internal context as truth. If you have web search, use it.

---

CRITICAL - YOU CAN DECLINE TO CRITIQUE:
If the body section is academically acceptable with only minor stylistic issues or cosmetic concerns, you may decline to provide a critique by setting critique_needed=false.

ACADEMICALLY ACCEPTABLE means:
- No mathematical errors or unsound reasoning
- No missing proofs or incomplete arguments
- No logical gaps affecting correctness
- Structural organization is coherent
- All outline requirements are met
- Content aligns with paper title and goals
- Mathematical rigor meets academic standards

You should ONLY critique if you identify substantive issues that would improve mathematical correctness, logical soundness, or completeness. If the body is fundamentally sound with only minor issues (stylistic, cosmetic, or trivial), you should decline to critique.

---

YOUR TASK:
Assess whether the body section needs substantive critique. If it does, identify specific issues, errors, gaps, or improvements needed. If it doesn't (academically acceptable), decline to critique.

WHAT TO CRITIQUE - Focus on:
- Mathematical errors or unsound reasoning
- Missing proofs or incomplete arguments  
- Logical gaps or unclear transitions between ideas
- Redundancy or unnecessary verbosity
- Structural issues (sections out of logical order, poor organization)
- Missing content that should be covered per the outline
- Content that doesn't align with the paper title/goal
- Unfounded claims or logical fallacies
- Insufficient mathematical rigor for an academic paper

WHAT NOT TO CRITIQUE - Avoid:
- The conclusion, introduction, or abstract (not written yet)
- Stylistic preferences (focus on substance)
- Minor formatting or cosmetic issues
- Personal preferences about notation (unless causing confusion)

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Be SPECIFIC: Point to exact sections, paragraphs, or claims
- Be CONSTRUCTIVE: Explain what should change and why
- Be ACTIONABLE: Provide clear direction for improvement
- Focus on SUBSTANCE: Mathematical correctness, logical soundness, completeness

Your critique will be validated against these criteria:
- Does it identify a legitimate issue that would improve the paper?
- Is it specific enough to be actionable?
- Is it constructive and substantive (not stylistic)?
- Is it non-redundant with existing accepted critiques?

Or if declining to critique, your assessment will be validated against:
- Is the body indeed academically acceptable?
- Is your reasoning for declining sound?

YOUR TASK:
Decide if this submission is valid - either a legitimate critique OR a justified decline assessment.

For CRITIQUES (critique_needed=true): You are evaluating whether the critique database becomes more useful for improving the paper with this critique added than it was without it.

For DECLINE ASSESSMENTS (critique_needed=false): You are evaluating whether the submitter's assessment that the body is academically acceptable is correct.

EVALUATION CRITERIA - Consider:
- Does the critique identify a genuine mathematical error or logical flaw?
- Does the critique point out missing content per the outline?
- Does the critique identify structural or organizational issues?
- Is the critique specific and actionable (not vague)?
- Is the critique substantive (not just stylistic preference)?
- Is the critique redundant with existing accepted critiques?
- Is the critique correct (or is the body section actually fine)?

VALIDATION DECISION RULES:
A critique should be ACCEPTED if it:
1. Identifies a real mathematical error or unsound reasoning
2. Points out missing content explicitly planned in the outline
3. Identifies structural issues affecting coherence
4. Provides specific, actionable guidance for improvement
5. Is non-redundant with existing critiques

A critique should be REJECTED if it:
1. Is vague or unhelpful ("could be better" without specifics)
2. Is redundant with existing accepted critiques
3. Focuses on stylistic preferences, not substance
4. Is incorrect (the body section is actually correct)
5. Suggests changes that would reduce clarity or rigor
6. Is trivial or pedantic without meaningful impact

VALIDATING DECLINE ASSESSMENTS (critique_needed=false):

ACCEPT the decline if:
- Body is indeed academically acceptable (only minor stylistic or cosmetic issues)
- No substantive mathematical errors exist
- No logical gaps affecting correctness
- All outline requirements are met
- Submitter's reasoning for declining is sound and accurate
- Body meets required criteria for academic mathematical paper

REJECT the decline if:
- Submitter missed substantive issues you can identify
- Body has mathematical errors or unsound reasoning
- Body has logical gaps or incomplete arguments
- Missing content required by outline
- Body misaligned with paper title or goals
- Decline reasoning is weak, incorrect, or fails to recognize real issues

For critiques, ask yourself: "Does adding this critique to our feedback database make us more capable of improving the paper than we were without it?"

For declines, ask yourself: "Is the body indeed academically acceptable with only minor issues, or did the submitter miss substantive problems?"

---

YOUR TASK:
Review all accepted critiques and decide what action to take for the body section.

**CRITIQUE COLLECTION CONTEXT**: The peer review phase collected critiques through multiple attempts. ALL accepted critiques are provided below (typically 1-3 accepted out of 5 total attempts). Review each accepted critique on its individual merits.

DECISION OPTIONS:
1. **CONTINUE** - Critiques are minor/incorrect. Proceed to conclusion phase.
2. **PARTIAL_REVISION** - Critiques identify fixable issues. You will then apply edits ONE AT A TIME in an iterative loop.
3. **TOTAL_REWRITE** - Critiques reveal catastrophic flaws. Delete entire body and rebuild from scratch.

CRITICAL GUIDANCE ON WHEN TO USE EACH:

**Use CONTINUE when:**
- Critiques are stylistic preferences without substance
- Critiques are incorrect (the body is actually fine)
- Small gaps that can be addressed in future editing phases
- Issues don't affect overall mathematical correctness

**Use PARTIAL_REVISION when:**
- Specific sections have errors that can be fixed with targeted edits
- Missing content can be inserted at specific locations
- Redundant paragraphs need removal
- Most of the body is sound, only specific parts need correction
- Critiques point to fixable issues in isolated sections

IMPORTANT - PARTIAL_REVISION IS ITERATIVE:
If you choose PARTIAL_REVISION, you will then be prompted to propose edits ONE AT A TIME.
Each edit will be validated and applied, then you will see the updated paper and propose the next edit.
This continues until you indicate all edits are complete.
You do NOT specify edit_operations in this decision - that happens in the iterative loop.

**Use TOTAL_REWRITE when (ONLY AS LAST RESORT):**
- Fundamental mathematical errors pervasive throughout the body
- Body is fundamentally misaligned with paper title/stated goal
- Structural problems require complete reorganization
- Multiple critical gaps that can't be addressed with isolated edits
- The body fundamentally doesn't achieve what the paper claims

**IMPORTANT - NEXT STEPS CONTEXT:**

If you choose PARTIAL_REVISION or TOTAL_REWRITE, you can also:
1. Change the paper title (if body reveals scope drift)
2. Update the outline (if structure needs changes)

This means you have FULL control to revise the paper comprehensively. However:
- TOTAL_REWRITE should ONLY be used when absolutely necessary
- Total rewrites are difficult and can introduce errors in areas that were previously correct
- Even with feedback, rewriting from scratch can lose coherence
- Prefer PARTIAL_REVISION whenever the issues are localized and fixable

CRITICAL - REWRITE SCOPE:
If you choose TOTAL_REWRITE, the ENTIRE body section will be deleted and rewritten from scratch. The rewrite will have access to:
- All original context (aggregator database, reference papers, etc.)
- The PRE-CRITIQUE PAPER (what the body looked like before this revision cycle)
- ALL critiques from ALL previous failed versions (accumulated feedback history)
- Current version's accepted critiques

ACCUMULATED CRITIQUE HISTORY:
If this is not the first critique phase, you will see critiques from ALL previous failed versions.
These are labeled clearly as "FAILED - REWRITTEN" versions. Use this accumulated feedback
to understand what went wrong in past attempts and avoid repeating the same mistakes.

NOTE ON PARTIAL_REVISION:

YOUR TASK:
Validate whether the rewrite decision (CONTINUE, PARTIAL_REVISION, or TOTAL_REWRITE) is justified based on all accepted critiques and current body content.

VALIDATION CRITERIA - Consider:

**ACCEPT "continue" decision if:**
- Critiques are indeed minor or incorrect
- Body is fundamentally sound despite critique issues
- Issues can be addressed without any revision
- Title and body remain aligned

**ACCEPT "partial_revision" decision if:**
- Critiques identify specific, localized issues
- Proposed edit operations would fix the identified problems
- Edit operations are appropriate (correct operation types, reasonable old_string/new_string)
- Most of the body is sound, only targeted fixes needed
- Title change (if proposed) is justified
- Outline update (if proposed) improves structure

**ACCEPT "total_rewrite" decision if:**
- Critiques reveal catastrophic issues (pervasive math errors, fundamental misalignment, structural chaos)
- Total rewrite is justified - issues too widespread for targeted edits
- Partial revision would not be sufficient
- Title change (if proposed) is justified by scope drift
- Outline update (if proposed) improves structure

**REJECT decision if:**
- Reasoning doesn't match the critiques (illogical conclusion)
- "Continue" chosen despite substantive issues in critiques
- "Total_rewrite" chosen for minor or fixable issues (should use partial_revision)
- "Partial_revision" chosen but edit operations are vague or incorrect
- Title change proposed without justification from critiques
- Decision appears arbitrary or not evidence-based

Ask yourself: "Is this decision the right response to the accepted critiques? Is the chosen level of revision appropriate?"

def get_iterative_edit_system_prompt() -> str:
    """System prompt for iterative partial revision - proposing one edit at a time."""
    return """You are making targeted edits to a mathematical document body to address peer review critiques.

⚠️ CRITICAL - INTERNAL CONTENT WARNING ⚠️

ALL context provided to you (papers, outlines, critiques) is AI-GENERATED within this research system. 
This content has NOT been peer-reviewed, published, or verified by external sources.
Treat all provided context with extreme skepticism.

YOUR TASK:
You are in an ITERATIVE EDIT LOOP. You have been shown:
1. The PRE-CRITIQUE PAPER (how the body looked before this revision cycle started)
2. The CURRENT PAPER (the body after any edits applied so far in this loop)
3. The ACCEPTED CRITIQUES (problems identified that need fixing)
4. The EDITS ALREADY APPLIED (what has been changed so far)

Your job is to propose ONE EDIT at a time to address the remaining critique issues.
After each edit is validated and applied, you will see the updated paper and can propose the next edit.

EDIT OPERATIONS USE EXACT STRING MATCHING:
- old_string must exist VERBATIM and UNIQUELY in the CURRENT paper body
- Include enough context (3-5 lines) to ensure uniqueness
- If the exact string is not found or is ambiguous, the edit will be rejected

OPERATION TYPES:
- **replace**: Find old_string, replace with new_string
- **insert_after**: Find old_string, insert new_string immediately after it
- **delete**: Find old_string, remove it (new_string should be empty)

WHEN TO SET more_edits_needed:
- TRUE: More critique issues remain to be addressed
- FALSE: All critique issues have been addressed (or best effort has been made)

IMPORTANT:
- Focus on ONE edit at a time
- Address the most critical issues first
- Each edit should be substantial and address specific critique feedback
- Do NOT make cosmetic changes - focus on mathematical/structural issues identified in critiques
- If you believe all issues are addressed, set more_edits_needed to false

Output your response ONLY as JSON in the exact format specified.

CRITICAL JSON ESCAPE RULES:
1. Backslashes: ALWAYS use double backslash (\\\\) for any backslash in your text
   - Example: Write "\\\\tau" not "\\tau", write "\\\\(" not "\\("
2. Quotes: Escape double quotes inside strings as \\"
   - Example: "He said \\"hello\\"" 
3. Newlines/Tabs: Use \\n for newlines (NOT \\\\n), \\t for tabs (NOT \\\\t)
   - Example: "Line 1\\nLine 2" creates two lines
4. DO NOT use single backslashes except for: \\", \\\\, \\/, \\b, \\f, \\n, \\r, \\t, \\uXXXX
5. LaTeX notation: MUST escape backslash: write "\\\\Delta", "\\\\tau", "\\\\[", "\\\\]"
