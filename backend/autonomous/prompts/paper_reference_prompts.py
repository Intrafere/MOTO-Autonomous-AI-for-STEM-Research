"""
Paper Reference Prompts - System prompts for reference paper selection workflow.
Implements two-step process: show abstracts -> show full papers -> final selection.

Supports two modes:
- "initial": Pre-brainstorm selection (select papers to inform brainstorm exploration)
- "additional": Pre-paper selection (select additional papers, keeping already-selected ones)

This is the CRUCIAL MECHANISM that enables COMPOUNDING KNOWLEDGE across research cycles.
By selecting reference papers before brainstorming, submitters can:
- Build upon proven mathematical frameworks from prior papers
- Avoid re-exploring territory already covered in depth
- Identify novel connections between new topics and established results
- Accelerate convergence on valuable insights by standing on prior work

    return """You are selecting reference papers to inform your upcoming BRAINSTORM EXPLORATION. Your role is to:

1. Review your brainstorm topic that you will explore
2. Review titles and abstracts of existing papers in the library
3. Identify which papers would be VERY USEFUL to have as context DURING brainstorming

⚠️ CRITICAL - INTERNAL CONTENT WARNING ⚠️

ALL context provided to you (brainstorm databases, accepted submissions, papers, reference materials, outlines, previous document content) is AI-GENERATED within this research system. This content has NOT been peer-reviewed, published, or verified by external sources.

YOU MUST TREAT ALL PROVIDED CONTEXT WITH EXTREME SKEPTICISM:
- NEVER assume claims are true because they "sound good" or "fit well"
- NEVER trust information simply because it appears in "accepted submissions" or "papers"
- ALWAYS verify information independently before using or building upon it
- NEVER cite internal documents as authoritative or established sources
- Question and validate every assertion, even if it appears in validated content

WEB SEARCH STRONGLY ENCOURAGED:
If your model has access to real-time web search capabilities (such as Perplexity Sonar or similar), you are STRONGLY ENCOURAGED to use them to:
- Verify mathematical claims against current published research
- Access recent developments and contemporary mathematical literature
- Cross-reference theorems, proofs, and techniques with authoritative sources
- Supplement analysis with verified external information
- Validate approaches against established mathematical consensus

The internal context shows what has been explored by AI agents, NOT what has been proven correct. Your role is to generate rigorous, verifiable mathematical content. Use all available resources - internal context as exploration history, your base knowledge for reasoning, and web search (if available) for verification and current information.

WHEN IN DOUBT: Verify independently. Do not assume. Do not trust unverified internal context as truth. If you have web search, use it.

YOUR TASK:
Determine which papers (if any) would be VERY USEFUL to inform and enhance your brainstorm exploration.

WHY THIS MATTERS - COMPOUNDING KNOWLEDGE:
This is the crucial mechanism that allows the system to compound knowledge across research cycles.
By selecting reference papers BEFORE brainstorming, you can:
- Build upon proven mathematical frameworks from prior papers
- Avoid re-exploring territory already covered in depth
- Identify novel connections between your new topic and established results
- Accelerate convergence on valuable insights by standing on prior work

THRESHOLD: "VERY USEFUL FOR BRAINSTORMING"
- Papers that provide mathematical foundations you'll build upon
- Papers that cover related concepts you can extend or connect to
- Papers that offer techniques or methods relevant to your topic
- Don't request papers that are merely tangentially related

OPTIONS:
1. Request to EXPAND specific papers (see full content before deciding)
2. Proceed WITHOUT references (none meet the "very useful" threshold)

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- You can select up to 6 papers maximum
- These papers will be available during your entire brainstorm exploration
- The same papers will also be available during paper writing
- Quality over quantity - only select papers you genuinely need

CRITICAL JSON ESCAPE RULES:
1. Backslashes: ALWAYS use double backslash (\\\\) for any backslash in your text
2. Quotes: Escape double quotes inside strings as \\"
3. Newlines/Tabs: Use \\n for newlines, \\t for tabs

Output your decision ONLY as JSON in the required format."""

YOUR TASK:
Determine if any ADDITIONAL papers would be valuable for paper compilation, based on what you learned during brainstorming.

CONTEXT:
- You already selected reference papers before brainstorming (shown as "ALREADY SELECTED")
- During brainstorming, you may have discovered new connections or topics
- This is your chance to add more relevant papers (if any)

THRESHOLD: "VALUABLE BASED ON BRAINSTORM INSIGHTS"
- Papers that address topics that emerged during brainstorming
- Papers that provide additional techniques you now realize are relevant
- Papers that cover connections you discovered during exploration
- Don't add papers just to fill slots

OPTIONS:
1. Request to EXPAND specific papers (see full content before deciding)
2. Proceed WITHOUT additional references (already selected papers are sufficient)

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- Check how many slots remain (max 6 total including already selected)
- Already selected papers WILL be kept - you're only adding new ones
- Quality over quantity - only add genuinely useful papers
